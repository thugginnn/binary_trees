# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

## Description

A binary tree is a data structure comprising nodes, each having at most two children: a left child and a right child. It efficiently stores data in a hierarchical manner, enabling quick insertion, deletion, and search operations. Binary trees find applications in sorting data, implementing search algorithms, and more.

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding binary trees
- Differentiating between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- Time complexity gains compared to linked lists
- Concepts of depth, height, and size of a binary tree
- Traversal methods: pre-order, in-order, post-order
- Types of binary trees: complete, full, perfect, balanced

## Usage

- Developed and compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc 4.8.4 with flags: -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic
- Linted for syntax and style compliance using Betty
